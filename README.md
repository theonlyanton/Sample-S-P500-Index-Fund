# Sample-SP500-Index-Fund


I built an equal-weight S&P 500 index fund utilizing IEX Cloud Sandbox API calls. Sample stock data was collected and converted into a Pandas dataframe. I learned how to make batch API calls for faster HTTP requests. The number of shares to buy for each stock was calculated base on the portfolio value. An Excel file was made from the Pandas dataframe for presentation purposes. The project was developed using a Google Colab notebook.
